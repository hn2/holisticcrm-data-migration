Stop the MySQL server service by going into services.msc.
Go to C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0 (ProgramData was a hidden folder in my case).
Open the my.ini file in Notepad.
Search for 'secure-file-priv'.
Comment the line out by adding '#' at the start of the line. For MySQL Server 5.7.16 and above, commenting won't work. You have to set it to an empty string like this one - secure-file-priv=""
Save the file.
Start the MySQL server service by going into services.msc.
